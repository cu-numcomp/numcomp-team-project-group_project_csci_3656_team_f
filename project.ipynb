    "## Introduction\n",
    "I believe we could compare Dorothea's project of quadpy integration over different shapes to the scipy.integrate function that has a similar function, I believe. We would setup several time trials between the two methods and find out which works better in which scenarios. Then we need to find a way to \"break\" quadpy, is there a upper-limit or lower-limit to the size of a shape? Or is there a certain shape that quadpy will return a very wrong integration value? I think that would be enough information for this assignment\n",
